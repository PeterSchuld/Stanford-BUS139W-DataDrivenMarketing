# Stanford-BUS 139W Data-Driven Marketing
Stanford Continuing Studies course "Data-Driven Marketing" by Angel Evan — Customer Insights and Analytics Consultant, 
January 16 - March 2, 2018 (7 weeks)

BUS 139 is a course for those interested in developing a set of foundational skills in the use of marketing-related data. It is
expressly designed for students without math,quantitative or statistical backgrounds and requires no expensive third-party software of hardware—only a Mac or PC version of Microsoft Excel 2013 or later. Each session deals with a core data concept and is supplemented with “how-to” videos and exercises on a variety of tasks marketers commonly perform.

Tableau Public is an incredibly powerful business intelligence tool used extensively in analytics. In fact, it's what Angel Evan uses at his agency.
