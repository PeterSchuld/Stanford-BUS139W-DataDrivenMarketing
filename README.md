# Stanford-BUS 139W Data-Driven Marketing
Stanford Continuing Studies course "Data-Driven Marketing" by Angel Evan, Consultant. Completed Winter 2017-2018 

BUS 139 is a course for those interested in developing a set of foundational skills in the use of marketing-related data. It is
expressly designed for students without math,quantitative or statistical backgrounds and requires no expensive third-party software
of hardware—only a Mac or PC version of Microsoft Excel 2013 or later. Each session deals with a core data concept and is
supplemented with “how-to” videos and exercises on a variety of tasks marketers commonly perform.

Tableau Public is an incredibly powerful business intelligence tool used extensively in analytics. In fact, it's what we use at my
agency. This link will bring you to a public page where you can explore how various marketers have dealt with visualizing KPIs in a
dashboard environment. Note: I am not advocating these are all good examples, but examples nonetheless.
